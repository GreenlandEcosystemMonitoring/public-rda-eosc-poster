# Introduction

This presents the observations, lessons learned and ongoing activities in data management of [Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM)](https://www.g-e-m.dk), with a focus on taking an independent arctic data repository towards open science and meeting the FAIR data principles (<b>F</b>indable-<b>A</b>ccessible-<b>I</b>nteroperable-<b>R</b>eusable). Requirements on data management and demands for following the FAIR principles are more common today than they were a few years ago - FAIR as a term was only coined in 2016. The field has been, and is developing rapidly and we are excited to be part in both general and arctic data communities.

# 1. Awareness

Awareness and drivers of FAIR within the circles of the GEM data repository.

> <b>First level:</b>  Requests from expert users of our open data website to improve it on many points - external influence.

> <b>Second level:</b> Discussions and presentations in the project coordination group to make sure the data providers / scientists are involved in the reasoning, needs and choices for FAIR data. 

> <b>Third level:</b> Implementing with reference to [GO-FAIR](https://go-fair.org) and [RDA - Fair Data Maturity Model](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-data-maturity-model-wg/outcomes/fair-data-maturity-model-specification-and-guidelines-0)

> <b>Daily use level:</b> Dataset landing pages, DOIs, CC-BY-SA 4.0 license and improved metadata that's harvested by other arctic data portals, makes it much easier for people to find, understand and cite the datasets.

# 2. Community Knowledge and Guidance

Lifesaver: Targeted communities, tech-workshops with peer groups and guidance websites help us navigate and filter the uncertainty that abound when discussing standards, FAIR data, licenses, open science in an interdisciplinary context.

# 3. Key achievements and plans
 <div style="color:green">
 + Extensive review and improvement of metadata.
 + DataCite agreement and API integration to mint DOIs (identifiers).
 + Making endpoints for portals to harvest our metadata (science-on-schema.org, DataCite Metadata Schema).
 + Decisions on license terms taken within the project coordination group.
 </div>
 <div style="color:darkgreen">
 + Plans: interdisciplinary vocabularies, coretrustseal, big data, modernizing website, new integrations?: [EOSC portal](https://eosc-portal.eu/), [Data-One](https://dataone.org)
